          "questionText": "A particle of mass m is moving in a circular orbit given by r=Rcosωtî + Rsinωtĵ​ as observed in an inertial frame S₁. Another inertial frame S₂​ moves with uniform velocity v=ωRî with respect to S₁. S₁​ and S₂​ are related by Galilean transformation, such that the origins coincide at t=0. The magnitude of the angular momentum of the particle at t=π​/2ω as observed in S₂​ about its origin is expressed as (mR²ω)x. Then x is _______. (Specify your answer upto two digits after the decimal point)\n",
